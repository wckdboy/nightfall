# Phase 2 — Feature IR + Script

- **Weeks:** 8–16 (build plan)
- **Milestone:** `Phase 2` on GitHub
- **Status:** In progress

## Gate

All of these, with evidence linked:

- [ ] 20 reference parts (gear, bracket, enclosure, …) build headlessly in CI
- [ ] Changing one parameter rebuilds a 30-feature part in < 100 ms
- [ ] IR documents validate against schema v1 and migrate forward; ASan/UBSan clean

## Work items (build order)

## Log

- 2026-10-17 — Phase started after the Phase 1 gate. The IR schema RFC (0005) comes first;
  expressions build on libnf-math's expression language (#80), the evaluator on the OCCT kernel
  layer (#55) inside the kernel service (RFC 0003).
- 2026-10-17 — RFC 0005 accepted (review period waived by the maintainer): one JSON document,
  sketches inside the feature history, selectors instead of indices, content hashes of
  evaluated inputs, a new kernel-free module `core/ir`.
- 2026-10-17 — #90 document envelope: typed parameters, references and feature history;
  version checks, unique IDs, rollback validation, bounded load/save and preserved extensions.
  This is structural validation only. The normative JSON Schema, per-feature inputs,
  selectors, body/entity references and schema corpus remain in #90; expressions, units
  and parameter dependency evaluation remain in #91. No Phase 2 gate is claimed yet.
- 2026-10-17 — #90 publishes the JSON Schema 2020-12 definitions for all 16 feature types,
  sketch entities, constraints and semantic selectors. A shared valid/invalid corpus is
  independently checked with pinned Python test tooling in CI; native enforcement follows.
- 2026-10-17 — #90 native schema enforcement: load/save uses the embedded published schema,
  including recursive selectors and mutually exclusive operation forms. Native and Python
  checks share the corpus; reference annotations are collected for the semantic checker.
- 2026-10-17 — #90 semantic checks enforce body/entity namespaces and typed backward references
  across sketches, selectors, operations and external inputs, including rolled-back history.
  The shared corpus has 184 cases. v1 is the first format: older/newer versions are refused;
  there are no legacy files to migrate. Unit/expression evaluation remains #91, geometry #92.
  `nf_ir_bench` measures complete document load/save for 30- and 300-feature histories.
  Local Release medians (5 × 100, warm schema): 30 features load in 0.235 ms and edit/save
  in 0.370 ms; 300 features in 3.015 ms and 3.690 ms. These do not measure geometry rebuilds.
  `tools/check.sh`: 170/170 passed. ASan/UBSan: 169/170, no sanitizer diagnostics; the
  unchanged closest-point timing test exceeded 2 s (4.805 s), then passed alone in 1.87 s.
